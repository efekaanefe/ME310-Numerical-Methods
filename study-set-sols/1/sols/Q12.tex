\section*{Question 12}

The provided MATLAB code calculates the 0th, 1st, and 2nd order Taylor series expansions of the given function \( f(x, y) = 2\sin(x) + \cos(y) \) around the point \( (0.6, 0.5) \). Here's the breakdown of the code:

\begin{enumerate}
    
    \item \textbf{Given (Reference) Point:} The point \( (0.6, 0.5) \) is specified as \( a = 0.6 \) and \( b = 0.5 \).
    
    \item \textbf{Point for Evaluation:} The point \( (0.62, 0.48) \) at which the Taylor series expansions will be evaluated is defined as \( x = 0.62 \) and \( y = 0.48 \).
    
    \item \textbf{Function and Derivatives:} The function \( f(x, y) = 2\sin(x) + \cos(y) \) and its derivatives with respect to \( x \) and \( y \) are calculated at the given point \( (a, b) \). These include \( f(a, b) \), \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\bigg|_{(a, b)} \), \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\bigg|_{(a, b)} \), \( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}\bigg|_{(a, b)} \), \( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2}\bigg|_{(a, b)} \), and \( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y}\bigg|_{(a, b)} \).
    
    \item \textbf{Taylor Series Expansions:} The 0th, 1st, and 2nd order Taylor series expansions are computed using the formula:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
    f(x, y) \approx & f(a, b) + \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\bigg|_{(a, b)} (x - a) + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\bigg|_{(a, b)} (y - b) \\
    & + \frac{1}{2!}\left(\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}\bigg|_{(a, b)} (x - a)^2 + 2\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y}\bigg|_{(a, b)} (x - a)(y - b) + \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2}\bigg|_{(a, b)} (y - b)^2\right)
    \end{aligned}
    \end{equation*}
    \end{center}

    
    The 0th order term is simply \( f(a, b) \), the 1st order term adds the first-order partial derivatives multiplied by the differences \( (x - a) \) and \( (y - b) \), and the 2nd order term adds the second-order partial derivatives multiplied by the squared differences.
    
    \item \textbf{Evaluation:} The Taylor series expansions are evaluated at the given point \( (x, y) \).
    
    \item \textbf{True Errors:} The true errors for the 1st and 2nd order Taylor series expansions are calculated as the absolute differences between the approximations and the true values of \( f(x, y) = 2\sin(x) + \cos(y) \) at the given point \( (0.62, 0.48) \).

    \clearpage 
    
    \item \textbf{Display:} Finally, the results, including the approximations and true errors, are displayed in a table. The exact value is 2.049065243853894
